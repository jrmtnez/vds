# Vandalism Detection System

This repository contains the project I carried out for my master's thesis in 2015. It is a system designed for the detection of vandalism in Wikipedia. The main methods are developed in Java, and the feature extraction is done with the Theano framework in Python.

The article [Can deep learning techniques improve classification performance of vandalism detection in Wikipedia?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197618302501) briefly describes the characteristics of this system.
